# Trendyol Sales Performance Analysis  


## Project Overview
I am a student from Sabancı University, Cemre Çırak and this is my DSA 210 term project. In this project my aim is to analyze the sales performance of a white goods seller on the Trendyol platform and identify sales trends to optimize business strategies. The analysis will focus on exploring sales trends, evaluating product category performance, understanding pricing strategies and customer demographics through data available from Trendyol's seller platform between July and August 2024. The project will involve comprehensive data collection, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical and machine learning modeling.

## Objectives
- Identify peak sales periods and trends based on daily and hourly data.
- Evaluate and compare sales performance across different product categories.
- Analyze the impact of different pricing strategies on sales.
- Examine customer demographics and their impact on sales.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales and customer behavior.

## Motivation
I am interested in exploring the unique dynamic of e-commerce platforms and finding out which categories sell the most and identify sales trends and high-traffic periods. My motivation behind choosing this topic is to gain actionable insights into the  dynamics of selling white goods on Trendyol. These insights can help optimize business strategies on online shopping platforms related to inventory management, pricing, and targeted marketing, ultimately maximizing profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of detailed sales data collected from Trendyol’s seller platform between July and August 2024. Data attributes include:

Sales Date: Date of transaction

Sales Time: Time of transaction (hour/minute)

Product Category: Type of white goods (e.g., washing machine, refrigerator, dishwasher, etc.)

Price: Sale price of the product

Quantity Sold: Number of units sold per transaction

Total Revenue: Total revenue from the sale (price multiplied by quantity sold)

Customer Demographics: Age, location, and other demographic details (if available)xcel format. The datasets has information on factors such as sales date, sale time, product categories, prices, quantity sold, total revenue, and customer demographics (age, location, etc.).

## Plan
**Data Collection:** Data will be collected from Trendyol's seller platform.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Data standardization, handling missing values, and normalization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying sales trends and patterns.

**Visualization:** Using visualization methods such as bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps.

**Statistical Analysis:** Conduct hypothesis tests

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Regression models for forecasting sales, clustering techniques for customer segmentation.


## Hypothesis
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant relationship between product category, pricing strategies, temporal factors (day/time), and sales performance.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** There is a significant relationship between product category, pricing strategies, temporal factors, and sales performance. Different product categories, pricing levels, and times significantly influence sales results.
