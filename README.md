# Analysis Sales Performance on Trendyol Platform


## Project Overview
I am a student from Sabancı University, Cemre Çırak and this is my DSA 210 term project. In this project my aim is to analyze the sales performance of a white goods seller on the Trendyol platform. The analysis will focus on exploring sales trends, evaluating product category performance, understanding pricing strategies and customer demographics through data available from Trendyol's seller platform between July and August 2024. The project will involve comprehensive data collection, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical and machine learning modeling.

## Objectives
- Identify peak sales periods and trends based on daily and hourly data.
- Evaluate and compare sales performance across different product categories.
- Analyze the impact of different pricing strategies on sales.
- Examine customer demographics and their impact on sales.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales and customer behavior.

## Motivation
My motivation behind choosing this topic is to gain actionable insights into the  dynamics of selling white goods on Trendyol. These insights can help optimize business strategies related to inventory management, pricing, and targeted marketing, ultimately enhancing competitive advantage and profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of factors such as sales date, sale time, product categories, prices, quantity sold, total revenue, and customer demographics (if available). The data will be collected from the following source:

- **Trendyol Seller Platform:** Data will be collected directly from Trendyol's seller interface or provided reports in Excel format.

## Plan
- **Data Collection:** Data will be collected from the sales in July and August 2024.
- **Data Preparation and Analysis:** Data will be cleaned and standardized. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to identify trends and patterns using statistical methods and visualization techniques. Machine learning models will be applied for predictive analysis and segmentation.

## Hypothesis
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant relationship between product category, pricing strategies, temporal factors (day/time), and sales performance.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** There is a significant relationship between product category, pricing strategies, temporal factors, and sales performance. Different product categories, pricing levels, and times significantly influence sales results.
